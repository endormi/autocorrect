# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

## How to create a PR?

- Fork it!
- Create your branch: `git checkout -b my-new-branch`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Some text whatever'`
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-branch`
- Submit a pull request

### Adding or updating script

- Pretty much everything goes, just follow the format `:*:text::text`, if needed remove `*` to ensure that the user needs to press space before text changes `::text::text`.
